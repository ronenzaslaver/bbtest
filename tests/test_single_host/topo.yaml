# NO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE as it is saved in github. Create your own copy of the file and make sure it is not pushed to
# github. We recommend my_topo.yaml as it is already ignored in .gitignore.
# Once you have your topo file you can set BBTEST_TOPO_YAML environment variable and conftest will take it from there.
